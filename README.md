This repository houses the website by A.S.Reeve to presenting information about work I am doing and providing some educational materials I have developed for my classes. 

This web site is based on templates from HTML5UP and modified for use with the Pelican static site generator (theme downloaded from https://github.com/abeelen/pelican-html5up-spectral ). I have made some small modifications to this theme to:
 * change some of the background colors
 * remove icons used to embellish some of the pages
 * allow different background images to be displays on blog pages associated with different categories
Links to pelican and html5up are in the footer of this web page.
